# ReactClickyGame_Memory

Create a new React application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

This app keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
